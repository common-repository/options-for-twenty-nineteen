== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why can't I change the fonts? =

Changing fonts in a WordPress theme is not a customisation that is limited to Twenty Nineteen. There are lots of plugins out there that already perform this task. We use [TK Google Fonts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tk-google-fonts/ "TK Google Fonts") for example.
